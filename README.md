# DSSC: Course of Parallel Programming 
This repository includes slides and material for the course of Parallel Programming at the https://dssc.units.it/

## Course Description 
The course aims to provide a foundation of parallel programming techniques commonly applied in scientific computing. Three different approaches are presented during clasess: a distributed memory paradigm using MPI, a shared memory paradigm using OpenMP and the CUDA language for programming NVIDIA based GPUs. The lecture series is part of the course of High-Performance Computing. It is mostly an hands-on based course, but including a mix of both direct lectures and practicals. Therefore, participation to classes is strongly recommended to successfully complete the course.

The course is divided in 5 lectures. Every lecture is expected to be from 10:00 to 12:30 and from 14:00 to 16:30, scheduled as follows:
- 2 March 2019, Giambiagi Lecture Hall (ICTP, Grignano)
- 29 March 2019, 5 April, 12 April and 3 May, Room D ex-SISSA Building (ICTP)
- 10 May 2019, Giambiagi Lecture Hall (ICTP, Grignano)  

## Lectures Description

### Day 1
During day1 basic notions of parallel programming has been introduced toghether with the essential sintaxt for writing a simple OpenMP program. Particular focus was given to the concept of thread, the OpenMP veriable scoping and finally the work shraing contruct for loops parallelization. 

Assignments: none

### Day 2
During day2 the both concepts of syncronizathion and race condition were mainly introduced, including how those are handled in OpenMP.
